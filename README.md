# Fingerprint Voting 
This is a University module where we attempt to create a fingerprint voting
system for local elections that allows users to vote via their fingerprint as
a primary form of authentification.

## Running The Code
To run the backend use the following
```cmd
go run ./backend/cmd/main.go
```
